## Project Title
Prosper Loan Data Exploration

## Description
This project analyses data of a loan company and uses data exploration and visualisation to identify the pattern and criteria of irrecoverable loans.

## Files used
* prosperloan_exploration.ipynb
* prosperLoanData.csv

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 14897 records of irrecoverable loans. Some data wrangling was done to remove missing values and assign ordered categorical data types to some records, such as Credit Rating and Income Range.

## Summary of Findings
From the data exploration, it appears that many borrowers causing irrecoverable loans are having healthy Debt-to-Income Ratio. It was also observed that the loss amount increases as Credit Rating and Income Range increase. Majority of irrecoverable loans came people with income range between 25,000 and 74,999. However it is worth to note that a sizeable amount of loss also came from a group of people who did not disclose their income range.

## Key Insights for Presentation
1. Debt-to-Income Ratio is not a predicting variable for irrecoverable loan.
2. Income Range should be a crucial piece of information for loan approval.
